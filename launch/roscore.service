# Start roscore as a fork and then wait for the tcp port to be opened
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Source all the environment variables, start roscore in a fork
# Since the service type is forking, systemd doesn't mark it as
# 'started' until the original process exits, so we have the 
# non-forked shell wait until it can connect to the tcp opened by
# roscore, and then exit, preventing conflicts with dependant services
