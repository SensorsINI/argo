# For /sys/kernel files, 0666 (rw-rw-rw-) is often flagged by kernel build system, so 0664 (rw-rw-r--) is common.
# However, you specifically requested 0666, which is why the module code has it.
# Udev will try to apply it, but the kernel might still enforce stricter permissions.
# Let's keep 0666 here as you requested for global writability, but be aware of kernel's internal checks.
